# Tr√¶fik | your local docker server 

## Do this
Clone this repo to your machine. I have it in my homefolder in a subdirectory called 'tools'.


Check the example-files for docker-compose.yml configuration file and traefik.toml file.  

You should update these two files with a desired url you want to use locally to have traefik on.  
Either put one in the files and copy them to your folder without example- in front, or run setup.sh (**only works on mac or linux**).
